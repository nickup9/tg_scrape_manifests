SCRAPING: HOW TO DO IT:

Reconfigure config.py as you see fit, as I've yet to add arg parsing since I'm lazy

Then just run python3 on main.py

If you want to save your results, copy/mv them out of /data or rename your files as every run of script will overwrite anything named results.txt
and results_graph.png
