File with archived data from runs I did


Config settings were as follows:

    server = 'manuel'/'terry' (terry is outdated, need to rerun)
    
    year = 2020
    
    jobs = <depends on target department>
    
    download_okay = True
    
    base_url = f'https://tgstation13.org/parsed-logs/{server}/data/logs/'
    
    hard_reset = False
    
    data_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'data')
    
    player_pop = 1
